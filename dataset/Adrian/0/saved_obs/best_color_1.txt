a spacious living room bathes in a symphony of warm, golden light, emanating from a crackling fireplace, the focal point of the space. Flanking the fireplace are built-in, mahogany bookshelves, housing an array of books and decorative artifacts. A plush, sectional sofa in a soft, cream hue invites relaxation, adorned with a mix of patterned and solid throw pillows. A sleek, glass coffee table centers the room, hosting a vase of vibrant, fresh flowers. Opposite the fireplace, a large, flat-screen TV is mounted on the wall, surrounded by contemporary art pieces.
